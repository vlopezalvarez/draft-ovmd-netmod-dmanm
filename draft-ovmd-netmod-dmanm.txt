       An Approach to Expose 'Device Models'-as-'Network Models'
                     draft-ovmd-netmod-dmanm-latest

Abstract

   This document describes an approach for exposing Device Models as
   Network Models (DMaNM).  In particular, this document provides
   guidance for structuring a data model to facilitate the reuse of
   device models within the customer-facing interface of Software-
   Defined Networking (SDN) controllers.  The objective of this approach
   is to enhance the reusability of device models in various network
   scenarios and ease the mapping between network/service models with
   device models and ensure lossless mapping between the various layers.

1.  Introduction

   Network operators need to efficiently manage network elements
   (including, embedded service functions) throughout their
   infrastructure.  By implementing network-wide management and
   configuration practices, operators can achieve centralized control
   and better visibility over their network elements.  Doing so enables
   them to streamline operations, monitor performance, and promptly
   respond to network events.  Moreover, network-wide management
   facilitates the enforcement of standardized policies and
   configurations, thus, ensuring consistent behavior and minimizing the
   risk of errors or misconfigurations that may result in service
   disruptions.  Additionally, that approach enables operators to
   implement proactive actions such as performance optimization,
   efficient load balancing, and security policies across the entire
   network, fostering a more secure and efficient infrastructure.

   The ability to reuse device models may play a crucial role in network
   management.  Multiple teams within an organization, such as network
   engineering, operations, and planning, can benefit from leveraging
   and using these device models.  These models may serve as a common
   "language" for understanding and managing network services and
   elements, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different
   teams and systems.  The utilization of models from various teams is a
   key requirement for network operators.

   The IETF has made remarkable progress in defining device models to
   manage network element capabilities.  These device models, often
   represented using YANG data modeling language [RFC7950], provide a
   structured, standardized approach to manage various network devices
   and their features.  By leveraging YANG models, network operators can
   effectively manage the network element functionalities.  These models
   not only streamline network management but also promote
   interoperability between different vendors and platforms, fostering a
   more efficient and robust networking ecosystem.

   Some examples device models which can be to manage specific network
   functions are listed below:

   *  "ietf-routing-policy" [RFC8349]: This YANG model defines a generic
      data model for managing routing policies that can be applied to
      various routing protocols.  The model provides a framework for
      creating, modifying, and applying routing policies, which allows
      defining how routes are selected, filtered, and modified.  The
      "ietf-routing-policy" model covers features like policy
      definition, policy attachment, route filters, and route actions.

   *  "ietf-bgp-policy" [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model]: This YANG model
      defines a data model for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  The
      "ietf-bgp-policy" model is designed to configure and manage BGP
      routers and sessions, as well as provide a representation of BGP
      operational state data.  The model covers BGP-specific features
      such as peer configuration, address families, route filters, and
      route actions.  The model is intended to work alongside the "ietf-
      routing-policy" model to manage BGP routing policies.

   *  "ietf-access-list" [RFC8519]: This YANG model provides a data
      model for configuring and managing network access control lists
      (ACLs).  This model provides a generic structure for representing
      ACLs, along with the ability to define rules for permitting,
      denying, or assigning a specific action to matching packets.

   *  "ietf-nat" [RFC8512] defines a YANG module for the Network Address
      Translation (NAT) function.  Various translation flavors are
      covered: Network Address Translation from IPv4 to IPv4 (NAT44),
      Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4
      Servers (NAT64), customer-side translator (CLAT), Stateless IP/
      ICMP Translation (SIIT), Explicit Address Mappings (EAM) for SIIT,
      IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6), and Destination
      NAT.

   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) [RFC7149][RFC7426] controllers
   facilitate seamless communication and coordination between high-level
   management systems and the underlying network infrastructure.  This
   arrangement enables efficient translation of network-wide policies
   and objectives, defined by the Operations Support Systems (OSS), into
   granular, device-specific configurations and commands for the network
   elements.  A similar concept applies for orchestration scenarios like
   in Network Slicing [RFC9543].  SDN controllers are typically placed
   as intermediate entities between the OSS and the network elements.
   Figure 1 represents such scenario, where an SDN controller exposes
   its customer-facing interface to the OSS or orchestration layer.

                           +-----+  +------+
                           | OSS |  | Orch |
                           +-----+  +------+
                              ^        ^
                              |        | Customer-Facing
                              v        v    Interface

                     +-----+ +-----+ +-----+

                    Figure 1: An Example of SDN Scenario

   Figure 1 illustrates the hierarchical relationship between the OSS,
   SDN controllers, and the network elements.  In this example, the OSS
   acts as the central management system responsible for overseeing the
   entire network.  An orchestrator acts with a similar role in
   scenarios like Network Slicing.  An SDN controller, positioned in the
   middle, acts as an intermediary, facilitating communication, and
   coordination between the OSS and the network elements.  At the
   bottom, the network elements are directly controlled and configured
   by an SDN controller.  This architecture enables efficient
   translation of high-level network policies into device-specific
   configurations, ultimately streamlining network management and
   decoupling the systems from the network evolution.

   Device models were defined to be applicable in the network-facing
   interface of an SDN controller.  As a result, these models do not
   inherently expose/capture the necessary network concepts to make them
   directly applicable in the customer-facing interface of the SDN
   controller.

   Within the scope of the IETF, efforts can be focused on two
   approaches when it comes to creating network models for device
   models.  The first approach involves creating network models specific
   to each device model, while the second approach entails developing a
   generic and reusable structure for all models.  This document puts
   forth a proposal for a reusable structure, aligning with the latter
   approach.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Terminology and Notations

   The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

   The document uses the following terms from [RFC8309] and [RFC8969]:

   Service Model:  Describes a service and the parameters of the service
      in a portable way that can be used uniformly and independent of
      the equipment and operating environment.

      Examples of service models are the L3VPN Service Model (L3SM)
      [RFC8299] and the L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) [RFC8466].

   Network Model:  Describes a network-level abstraction (or a subset of
      aspects of a network infrastructure), including devices and their
      subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the link and
      network layers across multiple devices.  This model corresponds to
      the network configuration model discussed in [RFC8309]. : It can
      be used by a network operator to allocate resources (e.g., tunnel
      resource, topology resource) for the service or schedule resources
      to meet the service requirements defined in a service model.

      Examples of network models are the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM)
      [RFC9182] or the L2VPN Network Model (L2NM) [RFC9291].

   Device Model:  Refers to the Network Element YANG data model
      described in [RFC8199] or the device configuration model discussed
      in [RFC8309].

      Device models are also used to refer to model a function embedded
      in a device (e.g., Access Control Lists (ACLs) [RFC8519]).

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.3.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   Names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed using
   the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported
   modules, as shown in Table 1.

              +========+=======================+===========+
              | Prefix | Yang Module           | Reference |
              +========+=======================+===========+
              | grp    | ietf-grp-ntw-elements | RFCXXX    |
              +--------+-----------------------+-----------+

         to this document.  Please remove this note in that case.

3.  Sample Use Cases

3.1.  "Device Config"-as-a-Service

   "Device Config"-as-a-Service involves the use of device models by an
   OSS to configure network elements through the SDN controller.  In
   this scenario, the SDN controller acts as an intermediary between the
   OSS and the network elements, providing a configuration service for
   each network element.

   By leveraging device models, the OSS gains a common representation of
   the network elements' capabilities and configuration parameters.
   These device models define the desired configuration for specific
   functions, such as ACLs or routing policies.  The OSS utilizes these
   device models to define the desired configuration for each network
   element.

   Through an SDN controller, the OSS can send the configuration
   instructions based on the device models to the respective network
   elements.  The SDN controller translates and applies the
   configuration, ensuring consistency and correctness across the
   network.  Moreover, the mediation of an SDN controller facilitates
   the access to the network elements from several users, applications
   or OSS minimizing the impact on the device.

3.2.  Profiles

   By leveraging device models, network operators can design profile
   that represent configurations for specific network functionalities,
   protocols, or services.  These templates serve as reusable building
   blocks, encapsulating best practices, and ensuring consistency in
   network configuration and management.  Once a profile is created, it
   can be applied to one or multiple network elements, either
   individually or in groups, depending on the specific network
   requirements.

   This approach not only simplifies the configuration process but also
   reduces the likelihood of errors and misconfigurations, ultimately
   improving network stability and performance.  Moreover, this process
   facilitates the lifecycle of the configurations enabling updating the
   profiles and, later, the network elements in a consistent manner
   across multiple network elements as a network-wide operation.

4.  Guidelines to Use Device Models in the Customer-facing Interface of
    SDN Controllers

   This section outlines two key concepts for the guidelines on
   utilizing device models in the Customer-facing Interface of SDN
   controllers: (1) groups of network elements and (2) a YANG structure
   for extending device models to enable network-wide utilization.

4.1.  Groups of Network Elements

   The management of groups of network elements is a requirement to
   cover the previous use cases.  It is intended to have a YANG model to
   tag a group of network elements under the same identifier, so the
   operator can apply a given configuration to a set of devices.  This
   document defines a module called "ietf-grp-ntw-elements", which
   provides a structured approach to represent and manage groups of
   network elements, enabling efficient network management.

   The "ietf-grp-ntw-elements" module defines a YANG model for
   representing a group of network elements.  Within the module, there
   is a list called "grp-ntw-element" that includes the groups of
   network elements.  Each group is uniquely identified by the "grp-ne-
   id" leaf, which has a string data type and represents the group's
   identifier.  The "grp-ntw-element" list has a nested list called
   "ntw-elements" to specify the individual network elements within each
   group.  The "ntw-element" list has a key of "ne-id" to uniquely
   identify each network element.  The "ne-id" leaf represents the
   identifier of each network element and has a string data type.

   Figure 2 represents the tree of the proposed YANG model.

                   module: ietf-grp-ntw-elements
                     +--rw grp-ntw-elements* [grp-ne-id]
                        +--rw grp-ne-id       string
                        +--rw ntw-element* [ne-id]
                           +--rw ne-id    string

                    Figure 2: Group of Network Elements

4.2.  YANG Structure for Extending the Models

   The document proposes a structure to enable the reutilization of the
   device models in network scenarios.  The objective is to create a
   YANG model with the device model and providing a nested structure to
   store deployment information for network elements associated with
   each instance in the list.  The guideline is to follow the next
   structure:

   *  An import of the device model.

   *  A container named deployment that includes:

   *  A list called "ntw-element" with the following elements:

   *  A leaf named "ne-id" of type string that serves as the network
      element identifier (which is the key).

   *  A leaf named "devmod-alias" of type string that serves as the
      device module alias for the deployment.

   *  A list called "grp-ntw-elements" with the following elements:

      -  A leaf named "grp-ne-id" of type string that serves as the
         network element identifier (which is the key).

      -  A leaf named "devmod-alias" of type string that serves as the
         device module alias for the deployment.

   Let us assume that there is a device model called "foo.yang".  The
   tree of the "foo.yang" model is shown in Figure 3.

                           module: foo
                             +--rw foo?   empty

                        Figure 3: Foo Tree Structure

   This document proposes the creation of a module that consists of a
   list of instances from the "foo.yang" model.  To iterate through the
   list, a key named "devmod-name" must be defined, which will be a
   string.  Additionally, the new model will import "foo.yang".  Lastly,
   a container called "deployment" will encompass a list of network
   elements, with each element identified by the "ne-id" and having a
   "devmod-alias" as an alias for the "devmod-name" configuration in the
   network element.

   An example of the proposed structure is shown in Figure 4.

                module: foo-ntwdev
                  +--rw devmod-list* [devmod-name]
                     +--rw devmod-name    string
                     +--rw foo?           -> /foo:foo
                     +--rw deployment
                        +--rw ntw-elements* [ne-id]
                        |  +--rw ne-id           string
                        |  +--rw devmod-alias?   string
                        +--rw grp-ntw-elements* [grp-ne-id]
                           +--rw grp-ne-id       string
                           +--rw devmod-alias?   string

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the "xxx" module:

   *  TBC

   *  TBC

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability in the "ixxx" module:

   *  TBC

   *  TBC

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:grp-ntw-elements Registrant Contact:
   The IESG.  XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA is requested to register the following YANG module in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG Parameters"
   registry group.

   Name: xxx Maintained by IANA?  N Namespace:
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:grp-ntw-elements Prefix: grp Reference:
   RFC XXXX

8.  Implementation Status

   This section will be used to track the status of the implementations
   of the model.  It is aimed at being removed if the document becomes
   RFC.
